<h1 align="center" id="project-details">üìù Project Details</h1>

This goal of this project is to support the generation, parsing, and interpreting of SPDX v3.0 reports. Currently, FOSSology uses SPDX v2.3 for report generation and ingestion, but with the introduction of SPDX v3.0, it has become the industry standard. Upgrading to SPDX v3.0 will address the limitations of the older version, such as compatibility issues and difficulties in integrating with other tools.
In this project, I worked on the generation of SPDX v3.0 reports in multiple formats, implementing SPDX v3.0 profiles, and then the ingestion of these reports.

The project focuses on several key tasks:
- Support generation of SPDX v3.0 reports in multiple formats: Include support for JSON-LD, plain JSON, tag:value, RDF, and CSV formats to meet diverse needs and use cases.
- Support of SPDX v3.0 profiles: Begin with Core and Software, and then expand to Licensing profiles.
- Support ingestion of SPDX v3.0 reports: Ensure FOSSology can read and process SPDX v3.0 reports for seamless integration and compliance.
- Integrate the codebase of previous SPDX v2.3 with the new codebase of SPDX v3.0 report.

<h2>1. Generation of SPDX v3.0 reports in multiple formats</h2>

In this task, I addressed the need to accurately generate SPDX v3.0 reports in the different formats such as JSON-LD, JSON, RDF and tag:value. Following are the new report samples:
- [Report in JSON-LD Format](./static/SPDX3JSONLD_Twig-3.10.3.tar.gz_1724610670.jsonld)
- [Report in JSON Format](./static/SPDX3JSON_Twig-3.10.3.tar.gz_1724610654.json)
- [Report in RDF Format](./static/SPDX3RDF_Twig-3.10.3.tar.gz_1724610679.spdx.rdf)
- [Report in tag:value Format](./static/SPDX3TV_Twig-3.10.3.tar.gz_1724610687.spdx)
</br>
- Reports can be obtained from the drop-down menu according to the required format and also multi-upload report can be obtained from the "SPDX3 generation" button.

- The Show Jobs page will show the scheduled report generation task accordingly.

<h2>2. Support of SPDX v3.0 profiles</h2>

- Core profile
    - The Core profile describes the foundational classes and properties that are used by all profiles of the SPDX model.
- Software profile 
    - The Software profile contains information about files, packages, SBOMs, snippets, and artifacts of the software application.

Implemented the following use cases as required by the organization under Core and Software profile:
<h4>- Person</h4>
<img src="./static/Person.png" alt="Description" width="500"/>
<h4>- Tool</h4>
<img src="./static/tool.png" alt="Description" width="500"/>
<h4>- File</h4>
<img src="./static/file.png" alt="Description" width="1000"/>
<h4>- Package</h4>
<img src="./static/Package.png" alt="Description" width="1000"/>
<h4>- Relationship with Package containing Files</h4>
<img src="./static/relationship.png" alt="Description" width="1000"/>
<h4>- SpdxDocument with Files</h4>
<img src="./static/spdx_document.png" alt="Description" width="1000"/>

- Licensing profile
    - The Licensing profile describes the aspects of licensing for the software application under three categories (sub-directories) - Licensing, SimpleLicensing, and ExpandedLicensing. The Licensing category describes information about declared licenses and concluded (detected) licenses. The SimpleLicensing category describes information about text-formatted licenses. The ExpandedLicensing category describes information about parseable and machine-readable licenses.

Implemented the following use cases as required by the organization under Licensing profile:
<h4>- Simple Licensing Any License Info: For all licenses</h4>
<img src="./static/anylicenseinfo.png" alt="Description" width="1000"/>
<h4>- Expanded Licensing Custom License: For Extracted License Info From File</h4>
<img src="./static/extractedlicenseinfo.png" alt="Description" width="1000"/>
<h4>- Expanded Licensing Conjunctive and Disjunctive Licensing Set: For Dual Licenses</h4>
<img src="./static/Dual License.png" alt="Description" width="1000"/>
<h4>- Annotation: For LicenseInfoFromFile and for LicenseInfoInFile</h4>
<img src="./static/annotation.png" alt="Description" width="1000"/>

<h2>3. Support ingestion of SPDX v3.0 reports</h2>

The project also addressed the parsing of the SPDX v3.0 RDF reports. This was done using generating graph using php's EasyRDF package. Using the generated graph, the data was extracted and loaded to enable the seamless parsing of the SPDX v3.0 RDF report. In future, this can be extended to JSON and JSON-LD reports as well.

<h2>4. Integration of the codebases</h2>

The project also addressed the integrating SPDX v2.3 codebases with SPDX v3.0. The migration involved adapting existing functions from SPDX v2.3 to accommodate the new specifications introduced in SPDX v3.0, ensuring that the enhanced capabilities of SPDX v3.0 were seamlessly integrated without disrupting existing workflows.

Throughout the 12 weeks of the GSoC period, I consistently created weekly documentation to track and record my progress. Week-wise documentation can be found [here](https://fossology.github.io/gsoc/docs/2024/spdx30/).
